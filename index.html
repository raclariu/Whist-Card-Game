                <h2>Rules</h2>
                <p>Romanian whist is a game for 3 to 6 players (best for 4). Each player plays alone.</p>
                <p>From a standard deck use 8 cards for every player (24 for 3 players, 32 for 4 players and
                    so
                    on, to 48 for 6 players).</p>
                <p>For 7 players a deck of 48 (6x8) cards is used and the dealer doesn't deal cards for
                    himself,
                    playing the so-called "dead hand". As the turn to deal advances around the table, each
                    player
                    plays "dead hand" several times during a game. There is also the possibility of adding 4
                    more
                    cards to the deck, turning it into a 56 card deck (for example some decks come with 4
                    jokers
                    which can be denominated as "1" card, the card with the lowest rank). In this case 7
                    players
                    can play normally.</p>
                <p>The cards rank as follows: A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, and so on. They have no value, because it is
                    a
                    game for tricks only.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Deal</h2>
                <p>The first dealer is chosen at random. Some players deal cards and the player who gets the
                    highest one, starts. Then the turn to deal rotates clockwise after each hand.</p>
                <p>The number of cards dealt to each player varies during the game. For the first few deals
                    each
                    player gets only one card. This continues for as many deals as there are players.</p>
                <p>After this the number of cards dealt to each player increases by one with every deal until
                    eventually all the cards are dealt, that is 8 cards each. Then as many deals are played
                    with 8
                    cards each as there are players.</p>
                <p>Then the number of cards dealt decreases again until every player gets only one card. Once
                    more
                    there are as many deals with one card each as there are players.</p>
                <p><strong>Example</strong>: With 4 players the whole game would consist of 24 deals, and the
                    number of cards dealt each time would be as follows: 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
                    8,8, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1.</p>
                <p>After the cards are dealt, the next card is put face up; the suit of this card is the trump
                    suit. In the games with 8 cards there is no card left to turn, and these games are played
                    with
                    no trump</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Bidding</h2>
                <p>Each player in order, beginning with the player to dealer's left, bids how many tricks they
                    think they will take. All bids are final and cannot be changed afterwards.</p>
                <p>To ensure that not everyone will succeed in their bid, the sum of all tricks bid must not
                    be
                    the same as the number of cards dealt to each player. (Example: game with six cards, three
                    players: The first player bids "3", the next "1". The last player cannot bid "2", as this
                    would make the sum of the tricks equal to 6. in this case, the last
                    bidder <strong>must</strong> bid 0, 1, 3, 4, 5 or 6).</p>
                <p>This rule puts the last bidder (the dealer) at a disadvantage, especially in the one-card
                    hands. To counter this disadvantage, a series of one-card hands equal to the number of
                    players
                    is played at the beginning and end of each game.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Play</h2>
                <p>The player to dealer's left plays the first card. The other players must play a card of the
                    same suit if possible. Any player who has no card of the suit led <strong>must</strong>
                    play
                    a trump if they can. A player who has no cards of the suit led and no trumps can discard
                    any
                    card. The trick is won by whoever played the highest trump, or if no trump was played, by
                    whoever played the highest card of the suit led. The winner of the trick leads to the
                    next. The objective is to win exactly the number of tricks you said you would win.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Scoring</h2>
                <p>The hand ends when all cards are played.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Players who made their contract (exactly) get 5 points plus the number of tricks they
                        made.</li>
                    <li>Players who took fewer tricks than their bid lose one point for each under-trick.</li>
                    <li>Players who took more tricks than their bid lose one point for each over-trick.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Suppose you bid 3 tricks. If you take exactly 3 you will win 8
                    points (5+3). If you take only two tricks you lose 1 point; the same if you take 4 tricks.
                    If
                    you take 1 or 5 tricks (two off from your bid) you will lose 2 points; if you take no
                    tricks
                    or 6 tricks you will lose 3.</p>

                <p>The number of cards dealt in each hand is recorded in the first column on the left.
                    Subsequent
                    columns are used to record the bids and the cumulative score of each player. In the
                    example
                    above, the first hand was a one-card hand. Peter bid 1 trick and made it (5+1=6 points),
                    John
                    bid 0 tricks and succeeded (5+0=5 points), Peggy was forced to bid "1" and didn't make it
                    (-1
                    point). The fifth hand was a three-card hand. Peter bid 1 trick and took 2 (-1 point),
                    John
                    was not allowed to bid "1", bid "0" and succeeded (5+0=5 points), Peggy bid 1 trick and
                    made
                    it (5+1=6 points).</p>
